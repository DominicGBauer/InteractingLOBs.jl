4. Figures  : A plot with at least 3 different Epps curves and envelopes for different choices of $\Delta t$ and fixed $\Delta x$.

5. Figures  : A plot with at least 3 different Epps curves for different choices of $\Delta x$ and fixed $\Delta t$.

6. Tables: With the calibrated model parameters using the NM-TA method (method of simulated moments).
